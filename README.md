and for block type formulas (displayMath):

$$\sum_i x_i$$

Hit 'Preview' or 'Save' to let them show up.


FAQ
------------
Q: Why do the formulas not show up in PDFs?

A: They do not show up in PDFs that are generated by using the PDF link below the wiki pages. See Closed Issue: Formula will not display in PDF export (https://github.com/process91/redmine_latex_mathjax/issues/1#issuecomment-4850823)
